# Micorservice Architecture with Docker and CoreOS
## Introduction
More and more often I am creating layered applications. I used to be able to write all my code in one repository and put all my web assets into my Tomcat war file. This was simple but probably not the best idea. As I started to work more with single page applications that were using web based APIs for their backends, this deployment was working anymore. My typical deployment was an application server (NodeJS, Tomcat...) for my web API and a Web Server (Appache, Nginx) for my static content. I would then need to cofigure the Web Server to act as a proxy to the web api to avoid issues with Cross Site Scripting. This was better because I could scale the servers independently of each other as needed. Then things got more complicated, Microservices hit the scene. So now instead of one applicaiton server I may have multiple application servers acting as front end proxies to numerous services that are running on different applicaiton servers behind them with all this still being consumed by one or more sets of static content being served up by web services. Fortunatly I started using Docker and CoreOS, I will go into a setup I have used with Docker and CoreOS on EC2 which allowed me to deploy these elements into a cluster, scale them independently of eachother and have them automatically register and communicate with each other. This same cluster can be deployed locally for testing.
